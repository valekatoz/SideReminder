# SideReminder

SideReminder is a simple website that helps you remember your weekly refresh for services like Sideloadly. Unlike AltStore, Sideloadly allows you to sideload up to 3 applications for free. This means you need to refresh your apps every seven days, or they will stop working. 

With SideReminder, you can set up reminders for each app and receive notifications when it's time to refresh them. You can also track the expiry date of your certificates and get notified when they are about to expire.

## How to use

    1. Go to the SideReminder website.
    2. Allow cookies and enable JavaScript in your browser settings. (Usually both are default)
    3. Add your apps and set up reminders for each one.
    4. Enjoy hassle-free sideload reminders!

## Hosting

SideReminder is open source and can be hosted on your own server. Here's how to do it:
