# SideReminder

SideReminder is a simple react website that helps you remember your weekly refresh for services like Sideloadly.

With SideReminder, you can set up reminders for each app and receive notifications when it's time to refresh them. You can track the expiry date of your apps and get notified when they are about to expire.

## Hosting

SideReminder is open source and can be hosted on your own server. Here's how to do it:

    1. clone the repo
    2. `npm install`
    3. `npm start`
    
Don't worry if you can't host it yourself, I am currently hosting it through Cloudflare Pages. However, please be aware that I cannot guarantee its availability or safety for long-term use.
